## Formal Specification Using Petri Nets 
 `By using Petri Nets I formally specified the following system:`

We have a traffic intersection that regulates the traffic of four different lanes, only certain signals can be green at a specific time and the rest of the signals are red

**Signals should work in an orderly manner according to the numbering shown in the image.**
 
- The two signals in lanes 1 can be green at the same time, and the rest of the signals are red
- The two signals in lanes 2 can be green at the same time, and the rest of the lights are red
- The signal in lane 3 can be green and the rest of the signals are red
- The signal in lane 4 can be green and the rest of the signals are red
- The signals in lane 5 allow cars to reverse traffic when it does not interfere with another signal

## The Tool Used To Formally Specification The System
[APO](https://apo.adrian-jagusch.de/) is a web interface for APT, a powerful software for Petri Nets analysis and synthesis developed at the Carl von Ossietzky university in Oldenburg, Germany, and is developed by Adrian Jagusch.(https://apo.adrian-jagusch.de/)
